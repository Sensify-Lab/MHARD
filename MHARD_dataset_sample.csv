My emotions and mental state fluctuate wildly throughout the day and I like to be able to track that, instead of trying to summarize my overall mood for the day. My favorite feature is just the ability to visualize my mood history, and I appreciate the questions asked at every check-in. It helps me gauge my mental health in a different way.",minddoc best mental health tracker ive used used use daylio prefer minddoc primarily x day checkins emotion mental state fluctuate wildly throughout day like able track instead trying summarize overall mood day favorite feature ability visualize mood history appreciate question asked every checkin help gauge mental health different way,13,,,5,5,5,5,5,5,5
